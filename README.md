# Datasets for ML
This repository contains code for an example Machine Learning (ML) project in plant health classification, more specifically, building and training a simple ML model to classify healthy and unhealthy apple plant leaves. You can use this project as an example to help you build your own ML model on a dataset of your choice. 

## Input
The data from this example was retrieved from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/skeef79/plant-pathology-more-data-no-background

## Configuration
To run this code, you need to have a version of python 3 up and running. This code was tested using python version 3.8.3. Python libraries including matplotlib, scikit-learn, imutils, numpy, cv2 and pandas must be installed in your python environment. 

### Python version
* [python 3.8.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/)

### Other libraries 
You can install these libraries using pip. 
* matplotlib 3.2.1
* imutils 0.5.3
* scikit-learn 0.22.1
* numpy 1.18.1
* cv2 (opencv) 4.0.1
* pandas 1.0.4

## Running this Code
Download all the files from the zip folder in this repository. Open a terminal and cd to the project folder (if you are using a python environment, make sure to activate it before). You can then open the jupyter notebook and run the cells during the tutorial. 

### Additionnal datasets
You can use this code to create a ML classifier on other existing datasets. Some examples include: 
1. The Flowers-17 dataset, an open-source dataset containing 17 categories of flowers with 80 images for each class which you can find [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/). 
2. The [Plant Seedlings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data) which contains images of seedlings from 12 different plant species.
