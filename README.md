# datasets-for-ML
This repository contains code for an example Machine Learning (ML) project in plant health classification, more specifically, building and training a simple ML model to classify healthy and unhealthy apple plant leaves. You can use this project as an example to help you build your own ML model on a dataset of your choice. 

## Python Environment
To run this code, you need to have a version of python 3 up and running. This code was tested using python version 3.8.3. Python libraries including matplotlib, scikit-learn, imutils, numpy, cv2 and pandas must be installed in your python environment. 

TO RUN

Download all the files from the zip folder in this repository. Open a terminal and cd to the project folder (if you are using a python environment, make sure to activate it before). You can then open the jupyter notebook and run the cells during the tutorial.
